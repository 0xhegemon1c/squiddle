        <p> Check out my OSINT/Doxing tutorial (Part 2) (Buscador) <a style="color: rgb(13, 165, 82)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvwSkhcqO_Q"> here. </a>  </p>
<p> The PDF version of the PowerPoint presentation for part 1 can be downloaded <a style="color: rgb(13, 165, 82)" href="Mining Personal Data Part 1.pdf" download>Here.</a><br>
<p> Some topics that we didn't get to cover in the video will be covered on this page. <br>
    This includes topics such as API, and social/engineering hacking tactics that can be used for recon (such as phishing). <br>
    We will also go more in-depth on radio frequency monitoring. </p>

<p>I have an upcoming presentation that covers social engineering tactics and reading body language. <br>
I am mainly self-taught but I did recently purchase Michael Bazzell's Open Source Intelligence Techniques (6th Edition). <br>
I also own his 2016 version of Hiding From The Internet. These are my favorites and I was happy to learn that I already <br>
knew most of the information contained in these books. Adrien Crenshaw, owner of Irongeek.com, also has several useful <br>
tutorials on doxing. For reading body language and social engineering, I use Kevin Mitnick's The Art of Deception and <br>
    The Definitive Book of Body Language by Allan and Barbara Pease. I am hoping to expand upon this collection.</p> </div>
