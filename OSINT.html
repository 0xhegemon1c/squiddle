    We will also go more in-depth on radio frequency monitoring, on my HAM Radio Blog section. </p>

<p>I have an upcoming presentation that covers protecting your personal data and online identity. <br>
I am mainly self-taught but I did recently purchase Michael Bazzell's Open Source Intelligence Techniques (6th Edition). <br>
I also own his 2016 version of Hiding From The Internet. These are my favorites, and I was happy to learn that I already <br>
knew most of the information contained in these books. Adrien Crenshaw, owner of Irongeek.com, also has several useful <br>
tutorials on doxing. I read the books so you don't have to. </p> </div>
