    <h2> My Hacking Journey as a Neophyte </h2>
    <div id="text">
        <p>     I have always been interested in computers, and interested in hacking. With three of
            my family members being programmers and one family member being in IT, my interest was innate.
            <br>However, I began my journey with only one goal in mind: <br>
           <br> <em>Learn everything that I possibly can. </em> <br>
           <br>
            The deeper that I got into my obsession,<br>
            the more invested I became and the more I refused to give up when finding out that the rabbit hole was much deeper than I had originally thought. <br>
            I learned that "hacking" was far from easy, and I became enamored with (and sucked into the life of) technology and hacking. <br>
            I started out as a script kiddie before I realized that nothing in life that is worth doing is ever easy. <br>
            My journey led me through OSINT,&nbsp;HAM radio,&nbsp;building electronics,&nbsp;writing malware,&nbsp;and attending local Def-Con meet-ups.
