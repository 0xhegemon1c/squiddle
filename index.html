    <h1> Welcome to my Website. I'm Deus. </h1>
    <h2> My Hacking Journey as a Neophyte </h2>
    <div id="text">
        <p>     I have always been interested in computers, and interested in hacking. With three of
            my family members being programmers and one of my family members being an IT Admin, my interest was innate.
            <br>However, I began my journey with only one motive in mind: <br>
           <br> <em>Revenge. </em> <br>
           <br>
            This evolved into something else entirely, something more mature. The deeper I got into the knowledge that I required to achieve my revenge,<br>
            the more invested I became and the more I refused to give up when finding out that the rabbit hole was much deeper than I had originally thought. <br>
            I learned that "hacking" was far from easy, and I became enamored with (and sucked into the life of) technology and hacking. <br>
            I started out as a script kiddie before I realized that nothing in life that is worth doing is ever easy. <br>
            My journey led me through OSINT,&nbsp;HAM radios,&nbsp;building electronics,&nbsp;writing malware,&nbsp;and attending local Def-Con meet-ups.
