    <h2> My Hacking Journey as a Neophyte </h2>
    <div id="text">
        <p>     I have always been interested in computers, and interested in hacking.
            <br>I began my journey with only one goal in mind: <br>
           <br> <em>Learn everything that I possibly can. </em> <br>
           <br>
            I learned that "hacking" was far from easy, and I was quickly sucked into hacker culture. <br>
            I started out as a script kiddie before I realized that nothing in life that is worth doing is ever easy. <br>
            My journey led me through OSINT,&nbsp;HAM radio,&nbsp;building electronics,&nbsp;and attending local Defcon meet-ups.
