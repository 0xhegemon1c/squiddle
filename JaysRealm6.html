<p class="animate-reveal animate-third"> <em>  One engagement broke, as I watched her become abusive.  <br>
The first relationship I had, started that pattern: but I wasn't expecting it again.<br> 
I fell in love with a woman recently but watched her betray me; for her predatory boyfriend.<br>
I watched her make excuses for him and pin everything on me,<br> (she claimed to be an advocate for victims of abuse too).<br>
I watched her turn me into the enemy, and pull my friends away from me.<br>I swear to never let myself be swept away again.</em></p>
