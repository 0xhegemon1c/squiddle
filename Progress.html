        <p style="color: rgb(13, 165, 82)"> I do things. When I started learning in 2017, I couldn’t do these things.<br>
        I started out learning what I could from Codecademy. <br>
        I attended hacker summer camp last year. Best thing to happen to me in years.<br>
        I got my amateur radio license last year, along with a freeCodeCamp cert in responsive web design <br> (yeah I know my website is shit, I’m workin' on it).<br> 
        I’m working on a Python cert from Udemy, and upgrading my amateur radio license. <br>
        I’ve completed a few projects, and you’ll be able to check those out soon on my DIY blog page.<br>
        The IMSI catcher is the only thing still in progress on there. <br>
        I will be presenting a talk on FemTech at Summercon this year (2019), with a fellow DC217 member.
