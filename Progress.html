        <p style="color: rgb(13, 165, 82)"> Hello there! This is where I tell you about some of the stuff I've done this past year since joining the hacker scene. <br> </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(13, 165, 82)"> Thanks for checking in on me. </p> <br>

        <p style="color: rgb(13, 165, 82)"> In the past year I’ve learned programming fundamentals from Codecademy,<br>and received my Responsive Web Design certificate from freeCodeCamp.<br>
Oh yeah, I learned how to make this website.<br>

I took my first Introduction to Computer Science course at my college. <br> I started focusing heavily on open source intelligence and joined the local Defcon and 2600 groups.<br> 
From there, I started giving presentations on OSINT, and some other cool stuff <br> (like giving a laser demo where I pretty much just played around with a “high-power” laser).<br> 
I learned about how circuits work (sort of), and put together my first project: an FM radio. I'm still a member of DC217, but not CU2600.<br> 

I attended Hacker Summer Camp for the first time in Vegas: BSides, and DEF CON 26 (where my group ran the Ethics Village).<br> 
I recently acquired my amateur radio license, <br> and I'm working on getting my Front End Libraries Certification from freeCodeCamp.<br> 
I'm also enrolled in a Python course on Udemy.<br>Oh, and uh, I learned about basic stuff like PGP encryption, and how to use a few tools.<br> 
Give me a break, it’s only my first year at this stuff.<br> 

By the way, that corn? Yeah that’s me, Squiddy.<br> 
I designed that logo for CuteSec, which is the name given to both the local Defcon and CU2600 groups put together (kind of).<br> 
That’s how I got my nickname.<br> 

Check back in a year or so, who knows? I may have done a lot more stuff.<br>Next year I plan to be a QM goon at DEF CON 27.<br>
